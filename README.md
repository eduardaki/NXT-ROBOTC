# NXT-ROBOTC
Lego Mindstorms NXT Sumo Competetion in RobotC

SourceCode.c is used for non-threat robot and normally we use this.

VS code is special code for obvious threat robots; it has two code: VS_COLLISION does normal operation after avoided first collision. VS_AVOID does keep avoiding the robot and wait for their unexpected bug.
